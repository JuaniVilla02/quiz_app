# myFirstApp
This is the first app I built in Flutter while doing a Udemy course about Flutter
---
The app is just a simple quiz, in which you have questions (about me) and below it, possible answers to that specific question. If you know me well, and you have answered all the questions correctly, you will get an on-screen message saying: "You know me very well". If you haven't answered the questions correctly, you will get diffrent messages.  
  
  It's just that, but i wanted to make a repo so when I start developing big apps and projects, I will be reminded of where I started.
